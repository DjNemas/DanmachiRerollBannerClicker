## How does it works?
Set the Value for "Min. UR to Find" (Allowed are 1-10). This value let the bot know, on which minimum amount of UR found, the bot should stop.
You always begin in State "Redraw", when u hit Start. So be sure to be in Result Screen befor you hit the button.
Everthing else runs automaticly.

### Note:
This bot still could have some bugs. I tried to develop it as much save as i could in short time.
When you found issues or have new ideas, please open a new issues ticket on top. ðŸ’™
